// 8.7 Tell me what you would do if told to design the backend for a online chatting system.
// Designing a chatting server, it will at least provide:
//    1. Peer-to-peer chatting, which goes through the chatting server as relay.
//    2. Group chatting and broadcasting, which is distributed by the server.
//    3. It will be social, so people can make friends, which brings in graph theory.
//    4. If it keeps track of the chatting messages sent by the user, it will need massive storage to hold them.
//    5. Oh my god, what kind of companies would ask such complicated problem... I'm just a new grad, spare me.

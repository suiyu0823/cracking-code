If you have a 2GB file with one string per line, which sorting algorithm would you use to sort the file and why ?

Obviously, when interviewers say, 2GB file, they donâ€™t want to you load entire file to memory at once. 

1. divide file to with size of K, x*K = 2GB. load each file to memory and sort.
2. then next
3. sort all k files and merge.

// 16.1 What is the difference between process and thread?
Answer:
    Process:
        1. Basic element of resource allocation in the operating system.
        2. Possesses independent resources:
            a. code segment
            b. data segment
                i. constant data
                ii. global variable
                iii. stack
                iv. heap
            c. register
            d. program counter
        3. Have independent virtual address mapping.
        4. It has life cycle, it is running, in contrast to a program.
    Thread:
        1. Basic element of CPU scheduling.
        2. Possesses part of independent resources:
            a. register
            b. stack
            c. program counter
        3. Multiple threads share part of resources in same process:
            a. code segment
            b. data segment
                i. constant data
                ii. global variable
                iii. heap
        4. All threads in a process share the same address space.
        5. It has life cycle
